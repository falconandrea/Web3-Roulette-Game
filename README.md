LearnWeb3 Bounty: QRNG Roulette Wheel Bounty Challenge

## API3 Quantum Roulette Bounty Challenge

### The Challenge:

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to follow a step-by-step tutorial to code a Solidity-based roulette game that uses API3's Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) to ensure true randomness. You will be using Remix IDE to code and deploy your contract.

### Project Features:

Your roulette game should support the following betting options:

1. Users can bet on either the first, second or third dozen of the numbers on the board.

2. Users can bet on either the first or second half of the numbers on the board.

3. Users can bet on either the set of all even or odd numbers on the board.

4. Users can bet on all red or black numbers on the board.

5. Users can choose any one specific number on the board.

The winning condition is met if the QRNG-generated number lands on a user's selected number(s).
